        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been
        castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as
        pets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[3] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[4] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.[4] There are numerous cultural
        references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.

        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken
        spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia,
        according to the annals of Thutmose III.[7][8][9]

            "Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] However, thanks to its usage on restaurant menus, it has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English. In older sources,
            'chicken' as a species were typically referred to as 'common fowl' or 'domestic fowl'.[20]

    <h2>Etymology</h2>

    <p>
        This section needs expansion with: the origin of the term 'chicken' in general. You can help by adding to it. (June 2021)
    </p>
    <p>
        According to Merriam-Webster, the term "rooster" (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th century as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English "cock",[22][23][24] and is widely used throughout North America.
        "Roosting" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.[25]
    </p>

    <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>

    <p>
        Chickens are omnivores.[26] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[27] or young mice.[28]
    </p>
    <p>
        The average chicken may live for 5-10 years, depending on the breed.[29] The world's oldest known chicken lived 16 years according to Guinness World Records.[30]
    </p>
    <p>
        Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the
        same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of
        spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side
        under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A 'muff'
        or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.[31]
    </p>
    <p>
        Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore
        their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.

    <h3>Behavior</h3>

    <h4>Social behaviour</h4>

    <p>
        See also: Empathy in chickens
    </p>
    <p>
        Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking order", with dominant individuals having
        priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can
        lead to fighting and injury.[32]
    </p>
    <p>
        When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
        A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.[33] However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also
        to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.[34]
    </p>

    <h4>Crowing</h4>

    <p>
        Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although it is possible for a hen to crow as well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.[35]
    </p>

    <h4>Rooster crowing contests</h4>

    <p>
        Rooster crowing contests, also known as crowing contests, are a traditional sport in several countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,[36] the United States, Indonesia and Japan. The oldest contests are held with longcrowers. Depending on
        the breed, either the duration of the crowing or the times the rooster crows within a certain time is measured.
    </p>

    <h4>Courtship</h4>

    <p>
        To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen ("a circle dance"), often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.[37] The dance triggers a response in the hen[37] and when she responds to his "call", the rooster may
        mount the hen and proceed with the mating.
    </p>
    <p>
        More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Male approaching the hen
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Male pre-copulatory waltzing
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Male waltzing
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away (if unwilling to copulate)
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Male mounting
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Male treading with both feet on hen's back
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Male tail bending (following successful copulation)
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
